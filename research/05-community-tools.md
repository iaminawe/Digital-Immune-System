# Community Tools Research

## Overview

Community tools enable democratic governance, structured dialogue, and collective decision-making in online spaces. This category focuses on mechanisms that distribute power, facilitate inclusive participation, and bridge online communities with real-world impact.

## The Challenge: Online Community Governance

### Current Problems

**Power Concentration**:
- Platform owners make unilateral decisions
- Moderators have unchecked authority
- Active minorities dominate quiet majorities
- Volunteer moderators face burnout and harassment

**Lack of Structure**:
- Chaotic discussions where loudest voices prevail
- No systematic way to reach consensus
- Difficult to have productive dialogue at scale
- Minority views easily drowned out

**Disconnection**:
- Online communities isolated from real-world action
- "Slacktivism" - low-cost online action without real impact
- Communities form around shared identity but struggle to coordinate effectively
- Difficulty translating online consensus into offline change

### Vision: Digital Democracy

**Goal**: Create governance mechanisms that are:
- **Democratic**: All community members have voice and agency
- **Structured**: Clear processes for deliberation and decision-making
- **Inclusive**: Diverse perspectives represented
- **Accountable**: Leaders answerable to community
- **Effective**: Decisions lead to meaningful action
- **Scalable**: Work for small and large communities

## Feature 1: Digital Talking Sticks

### Traditional Talking Stick

**Origin**: Native American (particularly Ojibwe and Lakota) traditions

**Function**:
- Physical object passed among circle participants
- Only holder may speak
- Others listen respectfully
- Speaker returns stick when finished
- Creates structured turn-taking and deep listening

**Purpose**:
- Ensures everyone can speak without interruption
- Reduces dominance by loud voices
- Encourages thoughtful, complete statements
- Builds respectful listening culture

### Digital Adaptation

**Concept**: Apply talking stick principles to online discussions using platform features and protocols.

**Implementation Approaches**:

#### 1. **Turn-Based Discussion Threads**

**Mechanics**:
- Moderator or system designates "speaking order"
- Only current speaker can post
- Others can react with emojis but not interrupt
- Speaker yields when complete
- Next person gets the floor

**Platform Features**:
- Temporary write-lock on thread
- Visual indicator of current speaker
- Queue showing upcoming speakers
- Request to speak / join queue function

**Benefits**:
- Prevents rapid-fire arguments
- Gives time for thoughtful responses
- Ensures quieter members can contribute
- Reduces impulsive reactions

#### 2. **Video Conference Talking Stick**

**Tools**:
- Virtual hand-raising (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- Facilitator recognizes speakers in order
- Mute-all except current speaker
- Visual timer for equal time allocation

**Challenges**:
- Requires active facilitation
- Can feel rigid for casual conversations
- Works better for structured meetings than organic chat

#### 3. **Asynchronous Talking Stick**

**Mechanics**:
- Forum threads with enforced response time
- Each participant gets 24 hours to respond to previous post
- Can only post when it's your turn
- Allows time for reflection and research

**Benefits**:
- Accommodates different time zones
- Reduces pressure for immediate response
- Encourages well-considered contributions
- Accessible to those who need time to formulate thoughts

### Design Considerations

**When to Use**:
- ✅ Deliberative discussions on important decisions
- ✅ Conflict resolution dialogues
- ✅ Town halls with many participants
- ✅ Sensitive or controversial topics
- ❌ Casual social conversation
- ❌ Rapid coordination (e.g., event planning)
- ❌ Emergency situations requiring fast communication

**Cultural Sensitivity**:
- Acknowledge Indigenous origins
- Respect traditional protocols
- Adapt, don't appropriate
- Consider making acknowledging these origins in the feature

**Accessibility**:
- Accommodates different communication styles
- Benefits neurodivergent community members
- Supports non-native speakers (more time to formulate)
- Reduces anxiety from fast-paced debates

## Feature 2: Community Ambassadors

### Role Definition

**Community Ambassadors**: Trusted members who help facilitate positive community culture, welcome newcomers, and bridge different groups.

**NOT the same as moderators**:
- Moderators enforce rules (often punitive)
- Ambassadors model and encourage positive behavior (supportive)
- Moderators have formal power
- Ambassadors have social influence

### Ambassador Responsibilities

**Welcoming**:
- Greet new members warmly
- Explain community norms and culture
- Answer questions about how things work
- Make introductions to relevant sub-groups

**Modeling**:
- Demonstrate constructive communication
- Practice NVC, empathy, charitable interpretation
- Show vulnerability and willingness to change mind
- Bridge across divides within community

**De-escalation**:
- Step into heated discussions to cool temperature
- Reframe conflicts constructively
- Encourage parties to use talking stick or mediation
- Model non-reactive responses

**Feedback Loop**:
- Bring community concerns to leadership
- Identify emerging issues before they escalate
- Suggest improvements to governance or features
- Represent diverse community segments

**NOT Ambassadors' Role**:
- ❌ Enforcing rules (that's moderation)
- ❌ Making decisions for community (that's governance)
- ❌ Having special privileges or status
- ❌ Speaking for entire community unilaterally

### Selection and Training

**Selection Criteria**:
- Demonstrated empathy and emotional regulation
- Respected by diverse community segments
- Active participation and community knowledge
- Willingness to learn and receive feedback
- **NOT necessarily longest tenure or highest status**

**Election vs. Appointment**:
- **Elected**: Community votes for ambassadors (democratic, but popularity contest risk)
- **Appointed**: Leadership selects based on demonstrated qualities (merit-based, but lacks community input)
- **Hybrid**: Nominations from community, leadership final selection
- **Rotating**: Different members serve terms, broad participation

**Training Provided**:
- NVC and conflict resolution skills
- Community cultural literacy
- Boundaries and self-care (avoid burnout)
- When to escalate to moderators or leadership
- DIS tools and best practices

**Support Structure**:
- Regular check-ins with other ambassadors
- Access to resources and mentorship
- Clear pathways to step down if overwhelmed
- Recognition and appreciation (but not status hierarchy)

### Real-World Examples

**Discord Ambassador Program**:
- Discord recruits active community members
- Help other communities build healthy servers
- Share best practices
- Bridge between platform and users

**Reddit Community Champions**:
- Experienced moderators help newer communities
- Share governance strategies

## Feature 4: Real-World Links

### The Problem: Online-Offline Disconnect

**"Slacktivism"**: Low-cost online actions (likes, shares, petitions) that provide psychological satisfaction without real-world impact.

**Goal**: Channel online community energy into meaningful offline action.

### Implementation Strategies

#### 1. **Local Chapter Formation**

**Concept**: Connect online community members in same geographic area for in-person meetups.

**Features**:
- Location tagging (optional, privacy-preserving)
- Local sub-groups or channels
- Event creation and coordination tools
- Shared calendar for regional meetups

**Examples**:
- Meetup.com model
- Reddit meetup threads
- Facebook local groups
- Discord regional channels

**Activities**:
- Social gatherings
- Volunteer projects
- Skill-sharing workshops
- Collective action campaigns
- Mutual aid networks

#### 2. **Action Campaigns**

**Concept**: Translate online discussions into coordinated real-world action.

**Process**:
1. Community identifies issue through deliberation
2. Town hall develops action plan
3. Working groups form around specific tasks
4. Coordination through online platform
5. Execution in physical world
6. Report back and celebrate wins

**Examples**:
- r/WallStreetBets → Stock market coordination
- Climate subreddits → Organizing climate strikes
- Local community groups → Neighborhood improvement projects
- Mutual aid networks → Supporting vulnerable community members

#### 3. **Advocacy Integration**

**Tools**:
- Direct links to representatives (email, phone, social media)
- Pre-written advocacy letters (customizable)
- Coordination for collective submission
- Tracking legislative issues
- Reporting on impact

**Platforms**:
- Change.org petition + advocacy
- Resistbot (text to representatives)
- 5 Calls (phone advocacy)
- Countable (track votes and bills)

#### 4. **Resource Pooling**

**Concept**: Collective economic action based on online community organization.

**Models**:
- **Crowdfunding**: GoFundMe, Kickstarter for shared goals
- **Cooperative Purchasing**: Bulk buying power
- **Mutual Aid Funds**: Support for members in need
- **Grant Making**: Community decides funding allocation
- **Investment Clubs**: Collective investing based on shared values

#### 5. **Skill Sharing and Education**

**Online to Offline Pipeline**:
- Learn skills through online community
- Practice in local meetups/workshops
- Build projects together in-person
- Share results back to online community

**Examples**:
- Repair cafes (electronics, clothing, etc.)
- Tool libraries and makerspaces
- Community gardens
- Language exchange meetups

## Feature 5: Elected DAOs

### What is a DAO?

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization**:
- Internet-native governance structure
- Decisions made collectively by members
- Enforced through code (smart contracts)
- Transparent and auditable
- No traditional hierarchy or CEO

**Core Technology**: Blockchain-based (typically Ethereum)

**How They Work**:
1. Community agrees on governance rules
2. Rules encoded in smart contracts
3. Members hold governance tokens (voting power)
4. Proposals submitted on-chain
5. Members vote using tokens
6. Approved proposals execute automatically

### DAO Governance Models

#### 1. **Token-Based Voting**

**Mechanism**:
- Each token = one vote
- Token holders vote on proposals
- Majority or supermajority required to pass

**Advantages**:
- Simple and transparent
- Proportional to stake/investment
- Fast execution

**Challenges**:
- Plutocracy risk (wealthy dominate)
- Low participation from small holders
- Can be purchased/accumulated for control

#### 2. **Liquid Democracy**

**Mechanism** (Aragon model):
- Token holders can vote directly OR
- Delegate voting power to trusted representatives
- Delegation is fluid and revocable
- Representatives vote on your behalf

**Advantages**:
- Combines direct and representative democracy
- Expertise-based delegation
- Maintains sovereignty (can reclaim vote anytime)

**Challenges**:
- Complexity for users
- Potential for influence concentration
- Requires trust infrastructure

#### 3. **Quadratic Voting**

**Mechanism**:
- Cost of votes increases quadratically
- 1st vote costs 1 token, 2nd costs 4, 3rd costs 9, etc.
- Allows strong preferences to be expressed
- Prevents majority tyranny

**Advantages**:
- Better represents intensity of preferences
- Minority protections
- Discourages vote buying

**Challenges**:
- Complex for users to understand
- Requires sufficient token distribution
- Can still be gamed

#### 4. **Reputation-Based Systems**

**Mechanism**:
- Voting power based on earned reputation
- Reputation from contributions, expertise, trusted actions
- Can't be bought, only earned
- May decay over time (stay active to maintain)

**Advantages**:
- Meritocratic
- Incentivizes positive contribution
- Resistant to plutocracy

**Challenges**:
- Defining reputation fairly
- Initial reputation bootstrapping
- Potential for insider cliques

#### 5. **Conviction Voting**

**Mechanism**:
- Continuous voting (not single events)
- Longer you support proposal, stronger your conviction
- Proposals pass when sufficient conviction reached
- Can move support between proposals

**Advantages**:
- Measures sustained community support
- Prevents flash mobilization attacks
- Encourages long-term thinking

**Challenges**:
- Slow for urgent decisions
- Complex to understand
- Requires active participation

### DAO Platforms and Tools

**Aragon**:

- Disrupts decision-making capacity
- Requires minimum quorum rules

**Concentration of Power**:
- Individuals/entities accumulate tokens
- Defeats distributed governance ambitions
- Whales can dominate votes
- Mitigation: Quadratic voting, reputation systems

**Legal Uncertainty**:
- DAOs exist in regulatory gray area
- Liability questions unclear
- Tax implications uncertain
- Difficulty interacting with traditional institutions

**Technical Barriers**:
- Requires crypto knowledge
- Wallet setup and management
- Gas fees (Ethereum mainnet)
- Complexity intimidates newcomers

**Governance Attacks**:
- 51% attacks (majority control)
- Flash loan voting attacks
- Sybil attacks (multiple identities)
- Bribery and vote buying

### DIS-DAO Integration

**Use Case**: Let online communities govern themselves through transparent, democratic mechanisms.

**What Could Be DAO-Governed**:
- Community rules and norms
- Moderation policies
- Feature development priorities
- Budget allocation (if funded)
- Ambassador selection
- Partnership decisions

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Not everything needs blockchain
- Use DAOs for major decisions requiring transparency
- Use traditional tools for day-to-day operations
- Start simple, add complexity as needed

**Accessibility Focus**:
- Abstract away crypto complexity
- Email/social login, not just wallet
- Voting via familiar interface
- Translate blockchain jargon

### Progressive Decentralization

**Phase 1**: Benevolent leadership establishes foundation
**Phase 2**: Advisory councils and ambassador programs
**Phase 3**: Binding community votes on specific domains
**Phase 4**: Full DAO with constitutional governance
**Phase 5**: Community self-governs, founders step back

### Real-World Action Loop

1. **Online deliberation** (town halls, talking sticks)
2. **Consensus building** (DAO voting)
3. **Working group formation** (ambassadors coordinate)
4. **Offline action** (local chapters, campaigns)
5. **Impact reporting** (back to online community)
6. **Celebration and learning** (build community bonds)
7. **Repeat cycle** (continuous improvement)

## Metrics for Success

**Participation**:
- What % of community participates in governance?
- Diversity of participants (not just power users)
- Sustained vs. one-time engagement

**Decision Quality**:
- Do decisions reflect broad community values?
- Are minority views protected?
- Do decisions lead to positive outcomes?

**Empowerment**:
- Do members feel heard and influential?
- Reduction in "powerlessness" sentiment
- Increase in community ownership

**Real-World Impact**:
- Online discussions → offline actions taken
- Measurable outcomes achieved
- Community satisfaction with impact

**Inclusivity**:
- Barriers to participation reduced
- Diverse voices represented in governance
- Marginalized members feel included

## Future Directions

- **Cross-Platform Governance**: Unified DAO across multiple social platforms
- **AI-Assisted Deliberation**: LLMs help synthesize discussions, identify consensus
- **Interoperable Reputation**: Portable reputation across communities
- **Legal DAO Frameworks**: "DAO LLCs" and recognized structures
- **Mobile-First Governance**: Participation via smartphone
- **Voice and Video DAOs**: Not just text-based voting

## Key Takeaway

Effective community governance requires:

1. **Structure** (talking sticks, town halls) to prevent chaos
2. **Democracy** (DAOs, voting) to distribute power
3. **Facilitation** (ambassadors) to maintain culture
4. **Real-world connection** to create meaningful impact
5. **Continuous evolution** through learning and adaptation

The goal is not perfect governance, but **legitimate governance**—where community members feel genuinely represented, empowered, and committed to collective decisions.

DIS can provide the infrastructure for communities to govern themselves wisely, compassionately, and effectively.
